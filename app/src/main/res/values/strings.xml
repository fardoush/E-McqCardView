        Dhaka District, Dhaka Jela also Dhaka Zila)\n
        is a district in central Bangladesh,[2] and
        is the densest district in the nation. It is
        a part of the Dhaka Division. Dhaka, the capital
        of Bangladesh, rests on the eastern banks of the
        Buriganga River which flows from the Turag to the
        south of the district. While Dhaka (city corporation)
        occupies only about a fifth of the area of Dhaka district,
        it is the economic, political and cultural centre of the
        district and the country as a whole. Dhaka District is an
        administrative entity, and like many other cities, it does
        not cover the modern conurbation which is Greater Dhaka,
        which has spilled into neighbouring districts, nor does
        the conurbation cover the whole district, as there are
        rural areas within the district.
